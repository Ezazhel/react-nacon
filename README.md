## **Part A: Store Component Wireframe & Design**
### Why I did not choose the infinite scroll
Google used infinite scroll instead of their pagination years ago. They choose to switch back to pagination.
Infinite scroll give you more retention on player (we all know how you are only scrolling on one instagram's reel and get stuck on the app for hours), but does infinite scroll give you pertinence when you want to sell a product ?

The products you want to highlight would be on the top while the less recommended would be at the end.
You want your player to play your game while they buy MTX. Allowing more time to play instead of getting stuck in infinite doom-scrolling, would improve the communication around your game, bringing more player, bringing more buyer.

Yet having an infinite scroll may allow you to display your item how you want. Infinite scrolling is not a type of display, it's a way to navigate.

### **Carousel**
Carousel design allows an item to take more place than a grid of items. If your intention is to highlight this item, let's say on your frontpage.
It could be interesting to provide a carousel display for it.

*Steam does it for example, but in their case they don't sell mtx they sell games and games have a lot of screenshot.*

If you are selling skins, a carousel could display on the left (taking more space) the skin on the character and on the right the name/price/rarity... any information you desire.

### **Grid**

A grid display is only a display. You could have a grid with infinite scrolling.
In my case, I prefer grid and pagination. If you have filters or sorting you may sort by decreasing price and go to the last page to have the less expensive MTX.

With infinite scroll you would need to scroll to the last page.

Do I need to say more ?

## **Part C: Store Administration Interface Concept** *(Optional & Exploratory)*
#### **Flow chart**
The flow chart only have two path, but we could add more depending on the objective of the backoffice.
I choose to display a flowchart for mtx's "CRUD". Adding/Removing/Editing item. And another one to add a banner (maybe on the frontpage ?)

What is truly important is not the flowchart, it's more 'how' are we choose the stack ? Through meetings mostly. 
MongoDB or Sql ?

Same Backoffice for each shop ?

Is replicating DB really necessary ? How much does it cost each month/year to maintain this solution ? 

How easily scalable is it ? A lot of questions still remains.
