# **Frontend Technical Test: Store Configuration Interface**

## **Overview**
Many free-to-play games rely on in-game stores for monetization. These stores showcase new content, promotions, and seasonal events. The layouts and components of these stores are often standardized and reused across multiple games.

NACON Live Ops services provide an administration interface for managing these store components within a web application. This test evaluates your ability to **design simple, reusable components** for that interface.

## **Time Management & Expectations**
We understand that candidates have varying availability for take-home tests. You are encouraged to **manage your time wisely** and communicate how you prioritized tasks. We do not penalize candidates for time constraints but value structured decision-making and clarity in execution.

- **Estimated Time to Complete:** 4-6 hours (flexible based on your approach)
- **Optional Enhancements:** Clearly indicated; complete them **only if time allows**
- **Submission:** If you choose to prioritize certain sections over others, briefly explain your choices in your README file

## **Test Breakdown**
This assessment consists of three parts:

1. **Store Component Wireframe & Design**
2. **Technical Implementation in React (TypeScript)**
3. **Store Administration Interface Concept** (Optional)

### **Part A: Store Component Wireframe & Design**
#### **Objective**
Design basic interface components for displaying in-game store products.

#### **Key Requirements**
Choose **two out of three** display formats:
- **Carousel View**: Displays one product at a time, navigable with arrows.
- **Grid View**: Displays products in a structured grid format.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Dynamically loads products as users scroll.

#### **Instructions**
1. Select **two** of the three display formats listed above.
2. Create a **wireframe** for your selected views.
4. Consider **usability and accessibility** in your designs.

**Deliverable:** Wireframe sketches (Figma, Adobe XD, or any tool of choice) and a short rationale.

---

### **Part B: Technical Implementation – In-Game Store Page**
#### **Objective**
Develop the interface components based on your wireframe.

#### **Implementation Guidelines**
- Use **React (TypeScript)**.
- Implement the **same two** store components you selected in Part A (**Carousel, Grid, or Infinite Scroll**).
- Fetch store products dynamically using a **mock API** (static JSON or simulated endpoint).

**Deliverable:** A working React project with documentation on setup and usage.

---

### **Part C: Store Administration Interface Concept** *(Optional & Exploratory)*
#### **Objective**
The `Store Administration Interface` is designed to allow Live Ops teams to edit the content of the in-game store, including products, promotions, banners, and more.

This content is also expected to evolve over time, adapting to promotional campaigns, seasonal events, and content updates. The adminitration interface should provide control over updates of the store over time.

#### **Key Features to Consider**
- **Store Edition**: Add, edit, delete, and organize store products.
- **Store Preview Mode**: View store updates before publishing.
- **Scheduled Updates & Promotions**: Schedule time-based promotions and changes.

#### **Instructions**
- Focus on **usability and ergonomics** of the admin interface.
- Provide **flowcharts, wireframes, or UI mockups** (no coding required).
- If time is limited, you may submit a high-level explanation instead of detailed designs.

**Deliverable:** Wireframes, user flows, or a short written proposal.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
Your submission will be evaluated based on:

✅ **Clarity & Structure** – Well-organized, logical problem-solving approach.  
✅ **Code Quality** – Clean, modular, maintainable React (TypeScript) code.  
✅ **API Handling** – Efficient API usage with proper error handling.  
✅ **Usability & UX Design** – Intuitive, accessible, visually appealing interfaces.  
✅ **Performance & Scalability** – Smooth interactions and adaptability.  
✅ **Testing & Reliability** – Basic unit/integration tests and handling of edge cases.

## **Submission Details**
Submit your solution as a **public Git repository** (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) with:

- **Complete source code**
- **README file** with setup instructions and a brief reflection on time allocation
- **Wireframes and design assets** (if applicable)

Good luck, and we look forward to your submission!
